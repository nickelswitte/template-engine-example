Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. We have a fantastic little sky! I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. Hello, Dexter Morgan. You're a killer. I catch killers. Hello, Dexter Morgan.

Hello, Dexter Morgan. Tell him time is of the essence. You look…perfect. I'm generally confused most of the time.

Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. You're a killer. I catch killers.

I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm partial to air conditioning. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I like seafood. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm generally confused most of the time. Watching ice melt. This is fun.

I am not a killer.

Only you could make those words cute. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I like seafood. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm really more an apartment person.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Only you could make those words cute. Makes me a … scientist. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.
